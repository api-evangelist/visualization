<p>Winter is over and its shorts weather these days in California.This is good for relaxing outdoor lunches but not so good for the drought.Its sad to drive down the state and see a bunch of barren farm land.Victor Powell shows this shift in water supply through reservoir data from the California Department of Water Resources.Each dot represents a reservoir, and the outer circle around each dot is reservoirs capacity.</p>
