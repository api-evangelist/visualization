<p>March Madness starts this week in the states, which means its time for bracket predictions and picks.Its when everyone in the office puts in 20 bucks, makes their picks, and whoever knows the least about basketball wins.FiveThirtyEight has their predictions ready.Like last year, their model estimates the probability that each team makes it through a round, and the probabilities update on each round.The University of Kentucky is a heavy favorite at a whopping 41 percent.</p>
