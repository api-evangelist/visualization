<p>Over the past five years, international agencies such as the World Bank, OECD, and UNESCO have created portals to make their data available for everyone to explore.Many non-profits are also visualizing masses of data in the hope that it will give policymakers, funders, and the general public a better understanding of the issues they are trying to solve.Data visualization plays a key role in telling the stories behind the data.For most audiences, data sets are hard to use and interpret â€” the average user will need a technical guide just to navigate through the complicated hierarchies of categories let alone interpret the information.But data visualizations trigger interest and insight because they are immediate, clear, and tangible.</p>
