<p>It seems like almost everywhere we look these days we see charts, graphics, and other tools of data visualization….election coverage, climate patterns, traffic, sports, rappers’ word counts, and Twitter posts, you name it and their data has been displayed in an image.Nowhere is this phenomenon more obvious than in business, where dashboards, real-time analytics, and explorable data sets are the hottest must-have technologies.But why?What’s driving this incredible growth in data viz (what the cool kids are calling it now), and is it just a trend?</p>
