<p>23 Feb 2015   
Some of the side effects of being so open and transparent about my ideas, like the one I had around API visualizations, is that people who are doing similar things, like Ardoq, eventually find you.Even better, is when someone closely follows your thoughts, and takes your ideas, and sets into motion, your original idea, in a way that will allow it to become bigger than the original idea.Last week Chris Spiliotopoulos (@chefarchitect) sent me an email, with a simple Chrome extension attached, asking what I thought.After installing the add-on (just drag onto your Chrome extension page), I visited my notebook of Swagger defined APIs over at API Stack, and when Twilio’s Swagger definition loaded in the browser, I saw a little Swagger icon show up in my browsers address bar—you know kind of like when there is an RSS feed available.I click on the icon, and a new layer to my browser opens up, with a simple, crude, yet potentially powerful visualization of Twilio’s API surface area.</p>
