<p>Nishith Sharma is the co-founder of frrole, a social intelligence startup.Raw data is boring and it’s difficult to make sense of it in its natural form.Add visualization to it and you get something that everybody can easily digest.Not only you can make sense of it faster, but you can also observe interesting patterns that wouldn’t be apparent from looking only at stats.To make the tedious task of making beautiful charts and maps easier, I’ve made the list of  best tools available for the job.</p>
