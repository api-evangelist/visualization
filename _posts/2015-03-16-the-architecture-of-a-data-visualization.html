<p>Information Design is playing an increasingly critical role in everyday journalism.The movement from word and picture to “words within diagrams” is building a new form of truth-telling and storytelling — and with it, a new journalistic aesthetic.At Accurat we’ve been working side-by-side with the newsroom of Corriere della Sera for more than 2 years, designing a series of of exploratory data-visualizations originally published for La Lettura, their Sunday cultural supplement.We aim to deliver rich visual narratives able to maintain the complexity of the data while making this complexity more accessible and understandable.Simply put, we publish compound and complex stories told through data visualizations.</p>
