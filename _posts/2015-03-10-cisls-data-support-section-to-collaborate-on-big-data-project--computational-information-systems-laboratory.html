<p>As the volume of data being produced by research instruments increases, new methods are required to validate, manage, and use it.CISL’s Data Support Section is part of a new multi-institution collaboration that will produce scientifically meaningful ocean data products for current and future research efforts.This project involves contributors from Florida State University (FSU), NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and NCAR.The project team leaders include Shawn R.Smith, lead investigator, and Mark A.</p>
