<p>Designer Michael Pecirno experiments with single-subject maps in his project Minimal Maps.No boundaries, just landscape.The data provided by the USDA is incredible and includes a tremendous wealth of information that makes up the composition of America.By pulling this data and extrapolating specific categories Ive been able to produce a number of unique and explicit maps that aim to push us away from the ubiquitous and low-resolution (regarding information content) physical and political map.</p>
