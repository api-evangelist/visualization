Silk’s visualizations can be embedded on other websites quite easily.We are thrilled that great publications like Mashable and the Daily Dot have used them to visualize data for their stories.The embed menu is now updated with a new ‘Embed size’ dropdown.It allows you to easily select and copy a pre-coded embed type.Options are ‘small’, ‘medium’, ‘big’ and ‘responsive’.</p>
