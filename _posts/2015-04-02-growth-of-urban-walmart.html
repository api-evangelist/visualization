<p>Maybe you saw the Wal-Mart growth map I made a while back.NPR takes a much closer look at Wal-Marts current growth strategy, as the store goes smaller and caters to more urban areas.That means less heads of lettuce and more pre-made salads.An NPR analysis found that in 2005, none of Washingtons 600,000 residents were within 1 mile of a Wal-Mart store.Today, almost 13 percent are.</p>
