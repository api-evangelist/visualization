<p>We’ve started working on a new API, to make things even easier for developers who want to hook into behind-the-scenes processes.At the moment, we’ve released a preview of things to come - a single GET method that enables you to pull data out of your widget, including any of our integration widgets.This way you can pull data from Amazon, Google Analytics, Zendesk and any other integration, via one simple API method, and add it to your business dashboard.As we work with APIs at Leftronic all the time, getting the online dashboards just right, we know what it’s like when a company upgrades their API, and the hoops developers using that API have to jump through to get their end working again.This is why we will continue supporting our API in the foreseeable future, and to make the transition smoother, the new POST method will be along much the same data format as our existing API, warts and all.</p>
