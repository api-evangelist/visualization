<p>Redesigning a visualization can be useful in teaching a point.Make a graphic better (or better depending on what angle youre looking from) with a different layout and visual encodings.Perhaps the most well-known is Edward Tuftes redesign from his book Visual Explanations in which he reworks a diagram used in decision-making for the space shuttle Challenger launch.However, Fernanda Vi√©gas and Martin Wattenberg explain why such redesigns can be problematic and offer a more useful approach.At the same time, redesigns can be problematic.</p>
