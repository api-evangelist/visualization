<p>This is why I’m so excited about Tableau’s forthcoming IPO.There are few companies that helped spur the democratization of data over the past few years more than Tableau.It has become the face of the next-generation business intelligence software thanks to its ease of use and focus on appealing visualization, and its free public software has found avid users even among relative data novices like myself.Tableau’s success and vision no doubt inspired a number of the companies I’ve already referenced.I’d be excited about an IPO if I’d own stock and the prospect of the IPO would make me rich(er).</p>
