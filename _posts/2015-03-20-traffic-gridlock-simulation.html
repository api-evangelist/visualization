<p>I hate all things commute- and traffic-related, and its probably why I like to learn about what makes commutes painful.Maybe if I know more about whats happening, I wont get so frustrated when I have to drive.Transportation engineering PhD candidate Lewis Lehe has a look at bottlenecks and gridlock, creating simulations of both.The former is when too many cars want to do the same thing at once, like enter at a freeway entrance.Gridlock is when a bottleneck in one direction causes a bottleneck in the other direction, and then the same happens the other way around, starting a horrible, horrible cycle.</p>
