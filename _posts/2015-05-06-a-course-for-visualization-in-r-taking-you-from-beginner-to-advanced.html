<p>Its the fourth year of running memberships on FlowingData (whoa).With at least one tutorial per month since the beginning, Ive worked up a pretty good collection, mostly in R.Each tutorial is self-encapsulated.Download the source and follow the steps.You dont have to work through other tutorials for one to be useful.</p>
