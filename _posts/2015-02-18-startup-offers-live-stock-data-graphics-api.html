<p>Investing in the stock market is sometimes seen as educated gambling, with highflying brokers risking everything in the pursuit of profit in an industry that easily intimidates those new to investing.However, Australian startup Simply Wall St has taken on the task of simplifying investing for everyone by using its unique “Snowflake” and associated infographic to represent the fundamental aspects of listed companies.While the application is still in beta, the company is launching the Snowflake Widget API for third-party integration.The API will allow third-party sites to display the Snowflake of any company on Simply Wall St’s database or display a random company that fits specific criteria.Currently, the application offers live stock data on companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq, the London Stock Exchange and the Australian Securities Exchange.</p>
