<p>With all the talk recently about how much water it takes to grow almonds, Kyle Kim for the Los Angeles Times took a quick look at home many gallons of water it takes on average to produce other foods.Although almonds isnt on the chart.Am I missing it?Update: Pretty sure theyre not on there, but heres some back-of-the-napkin math.The LA Times article quotes about one gallon of water per almond.</p>
