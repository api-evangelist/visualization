<p>Today OpenCorporates added a new visualisation tool that enables you to explore the global corporate networks of the six biggest banks in the US.The visualisation shows relationships between companies that are members of large corporate groups.You can hover over a particular company within a corporate group to highlight its links with other companies that either control or are controlled by the highlighted company.It also shows which companies are located in countries commonly held to be tax havens.As well as corporate ownership data, OpenCorporates also publishes a growing amount of information detailing company directorships.</p>
