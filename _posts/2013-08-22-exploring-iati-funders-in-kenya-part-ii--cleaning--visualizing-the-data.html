<p>Welcome back to a brief exploration of who funds whom in Kenya based on freely available data from IATI (International Aid Transparency Initiative).In the last post, we extracted data from IATI data using Python.In this post, we’ll clean that data up and visualize it as a network graph to see what it can tell us about aid funding in Kenya.If you couldn’t follow the code in the last post, don’t worry: we’ll use the GUI tools OpenRefine and Gephi from now on.You can download the result of last post’s data extraction here.</p>
