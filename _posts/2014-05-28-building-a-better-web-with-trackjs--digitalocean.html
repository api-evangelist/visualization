<p>In this guest post, co-founder of Track:js Todd H Gardner discusses his experience with transitioning more and more of his company over to DigitalOcean.In case you havent heard, Track:js is an awesome service for tracking and fixing client-side JavaScript errors.Were bootstrapping Track:js, so were perpetually short on time and money.We initially started using DigitalOcean for its price, but have stayed for nearly a year now because it works so well.Setting up Droplets is super easy and we have all the control we need to automate them.</p>
