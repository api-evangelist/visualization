<p>Last week Felipe and Michael from the Google Cloud Platform Developer Relations team released a video demonstrating the new Pearson correlation analysis available in Google BigQuery.Their example used more than 70 million flight records to find correlations on departure times, which could be used to predict whether your plane would be late.Specifically, you can find out which set of airports best predict your airport’s possible flight delays the following day.As you can see from their code (watch the video for context), they’re using iPython Notebook to work with the BigQuery results, and matplotlib to get a quick visual of results.But one aspect that’s hard to see in these results is the spatial relationship of the airports.</p>
