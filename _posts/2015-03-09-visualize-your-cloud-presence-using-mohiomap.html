There are lots of good visualization stories recently, or maybe I’m more focused on API driven visualizations.Who knows?This particular post is an API story because Mohiomap, the company at the center is using APIs to accomplish their “vision”, not because they have an API—which actually would be a nice way to pay it forward, but that is another story.Regardless, I think what Mohiomap is up to, is interesting on a lot of levels, bur primarily because in coming years we need to be able to better understand this new, cloud-based world we are  creating for ourselves.Why am I blogging about this?</p>
