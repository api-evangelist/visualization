<p>We launched a new website less than a year ago, corresponding with the release of our then brand-new commenting experience, called D12 at the time.The site was intended to showcase D12 and its new real-time features.We built a slick interactive demo – a demo that I’m still quite proud of – which, as of today, continues to serve as the hero piece at disqus.com.The demo does a great job showcasing the D12 commenting experience.</p>
