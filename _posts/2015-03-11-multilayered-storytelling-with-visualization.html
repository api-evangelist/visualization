<p>Quick and simple.It is a common theme in visualization that preaches clarity in as little time as possible, and it is certainly applicable in a variety of places.But is there a place for complexity in visualization that encourages people to carefully read what the data is about?Giorgia Lupi, design director at Accurat, thinks so.Experimental visualizations design should always aim at balancing conventions and familiar forms people are comfortable with, and novelty: truly imaginative visuals able to attract individuals into the exploration, able to transform the strange of any visual experiment we include into the known, and ultimately able to invite readers to explore the richness of the stories lying behind.</p>
