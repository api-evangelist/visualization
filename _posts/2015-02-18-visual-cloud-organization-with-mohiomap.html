<p>We save plenty of data into the Cloud.Documents, images, and a range of other various files can be spread across a wide array of Cloud storage providers such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote.Organizing this data in a coherent manner is one of the key use cases that our users have found when using Mohiomap.Our Cloud accounts can contain a chaotic mess of files: files without proper tags, files assigned to the incorrect notebook or folder, or files that we know we do not even need anymore and should be deleted.Your Cloud can become almost like the good old email inbox where everything just tends to “end up” and has more in common with a messy room than an organized digital workspace.</p>
