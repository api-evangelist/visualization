<p>As the industry’s leading music intelligence company, we’re sitting on mountains (figuratively) of data — precisely 1,156,164,514,645 datapoints about music at the time of this writing.That being the case, we appreciate as much as anyone else the art and science of data visualization.These are graphics that convey at a glance what would take much longer (or be impossible) to explain with words.We’re honored that two Echo Nest creations are officially in the running to win Information Is Beautiful Awards, whose motto is “celebrating excellence in data visualization and information design”: The Infinite Jukebox and Every Noise At Once.The Infinite Jukebox, created by The Echo Nest director of developer community, Paul Lamere, made the list for Best Data Visualization.</p>
