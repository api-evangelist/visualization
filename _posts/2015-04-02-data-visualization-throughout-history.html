<p>Data visualization has been around for a long time—far longer than computers have existed—and it is valuable because it allows us to represent a significant amount of data in a way that is easy for our brain to interpret.The first representation of statistical data (below) is credited to Michael Florent Van Langren, a Flemish astronomer.Created in 1644, this one-dimensional line graph shows twelve estimates of the difference in longitude between Toledo and Rome with the astronomer who provided the estimate.Since then, a lot of progress has been made in the field of data visualization.We’re not going to go over all of those discoveries; rather, this post will focus on several milestones from the last two decades in the data visualization industry.</p>
