<p>Open data API exploration and visualization tool XOData aims to make it easier for developers to understand the resources, functions, and parameters available for extraction from datasets created in the OData open data format.Ram Manohar Tiwari, founder of PragmatiQa and creator of the XOData tool, says the tool is suited for both developers and business users looking to explore existing APIs as well as to easily prototype and test APIs created in the OData format.OData is an international open data protocol standard aimed at encouraging best practice among open data publishers when building RESTful APIs.OData is the protocol recommended by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Systems (OASIS).Major libraries and publishers of open datasets often ensure that the source data is available in the OData format.</p>
