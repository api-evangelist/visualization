<p>Our Open Data Portal now includes a new view type − Data Lens.These views do not present any new data.Rather, much like charts, they offer a way to summarize and explore existing datasets.Data Lens pages are built around the concept of cards, with each card on the page showing a different way of summarizing the data in bar chart or map format or of filtering by a particular column.The real power of a Data Lens page is that the cards are linked so that filtering in one card filters all the others.</p>
