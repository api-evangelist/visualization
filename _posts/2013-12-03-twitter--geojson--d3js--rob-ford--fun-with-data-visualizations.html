<p>As a citizen of Toronto, the past few weeks (and months) have been interesting to say the least.Our mayor, Rob Ford, has made headlines for his various lewd remarks, football follies, and drunken stupors.With an election coming up in 2014, I was curious as to how the rest of Toronto felt about our mayor.Collect data from Twitter, making sure we only use tweets from people in Toronto.Plot those tweets on an electoral map of Torontoâ€™s wards, colour coding the wards based on how they voted in the 2010 Mayoral Election.</p>
