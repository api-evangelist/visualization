<p>At last month’s Tableau Customer Conference in Washington D.C., we ran a hands-on mapping session that showed how to create dual axis maps while retaining two measures, build custom regions, create a viz with open data and how to use additional data and services from Urban Mapping, Tableau’s official map provider, through Mapfluence, our mapping platform.Because Mapfluence has a direct connection into Tableau that does an end-around WMS, high resolution imagery can be seamlessly integrated into Tableau, tiling only the portions of the image you need as a base layer under your viz. Any data viz guru will tell you that unnecessary levels of detail clutter your presentation and obscure your message, which is why it is better to avoid a complicated base map where a simpler one will do.</p>
