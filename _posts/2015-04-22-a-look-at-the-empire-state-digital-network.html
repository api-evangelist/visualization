A few months ago Amy Rudersdorf, Assistant Director for Content at DPLA, contacted me for feedback on a visualization she created that illustrates the structure of the DPLA Service Hub in New York.After a few emails back and forth, we landed on this diagram of the Empire State Digital Network (ESDN).This is a very accurate 2-D depiction of our hub, but I’m amazed by how simple it looks compared to the complex and layered network we have up and running in real life.</p>
