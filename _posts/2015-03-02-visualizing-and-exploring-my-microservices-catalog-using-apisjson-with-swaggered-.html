<p>02 Mar 2015   
Im just getting started exploring the ways to use APIs.json when it comes organize my new Docker fueled, micro services stack.I’ve been using APIs.son to describe each micro service, as well as define the overall collection of almost 20 micro services.I’m using the include collection, as a navigation for the loosely coupled stack of micro-services, and my friend Chris Spiliotopoulos ( @chefarchitect ), has done some more work with his Swagger.</p>
