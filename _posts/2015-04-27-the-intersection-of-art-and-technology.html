Last month, I went to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City for the first time.I was there to see a special exhibit featuring the pop singer Bjӧrk, who is currently presenting a retrospective of her life’s work as a musician, artist and technologist.The retrospective spans back from her early beginnings as a childhood folk singer in Iceland all the way through to her most current album release.Being a huge fan of Bjӧrk’s work, and having a fine art background myself, I equate this experience to visiting an ancient historical site, relic or monument.After entering the exhibit, I was  instructed to put on a set of headphones and listen to a poetic narration, which guided me through each exhibit room.</p>
