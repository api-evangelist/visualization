<p>There’s a world of interesting open data out there—from weather trends to stock prices to world census data.All of which is potentially very interesting, but in reality, raw CSV data is often quite boring.Enter MisoData.Today, we launched our new Open Data showcase dashboard, which you can play with here.Using our new MisoData feature, we are able to visualize that data, chart it in different ways, and even add forecasts or smooth average curves.</p>
