<p>Im sure you finished your taxes months ago, but heres a chart of the tax brackets and rates in all the states in case youre interested.Each segment represents a bracket, and the darker the shade the higher the rate.Since this is tax data, theres a healthy dose of footnotes about taxes in various states.See Tax Foundation for the details.</p>
